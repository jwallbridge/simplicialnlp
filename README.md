* `notes-experiments.md` the experiment log.

The notebooks include (for n <= 3) :
* `trans_v1.ipynb` the vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al).
* `unitrans_v1.ipynb` the universal transformer (Dehghani et al).
* `simptrans_v1.ipynb` the simplicial transformer.
* `unisimptrans_v1.ipynb` the universal simplicial transformer.
