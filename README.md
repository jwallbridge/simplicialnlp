# Simplicial Transformer Architecture   

This is the code repository for a 2- and 3-Simplicial Transformer Architecture developed for the project [2simplicialtransformer](https://github.com/dmurfet/2simplicialtransformer) by James Clift, Dmitry Doryn, Daniel Murfet and James Wallbridge.  It includes both an Encoder and Decoder.

This repository currently includes :
* `attention2_layer.py` a 2-simplicial attention layer.
* `transformer2_100.py` a Transformer with 2-simplicial Encoder and standard Decoder.
